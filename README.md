# semi-analytical-hydro

matlab: see `src/matlab/run_MEEM.m` for the symbolic and numeric code, see `test/matlab/` for some scripts to get results.

python: see `src/python/MEEM.ipynb` to assemble the matrices and get results, and `src/python/` for some helper functions.

unlikely to be useful now, but keeping around in case: `test/time_comparison` for time comparisons of BEM (Capytaine), and `dev\` for various fiddly matlab experiments.
