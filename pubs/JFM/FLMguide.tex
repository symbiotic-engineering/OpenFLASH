\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Offshore structures are important amidst the growing marine economy for sustainable energy and food.
To ensure survival of these structures, wave loads are quantified using hydrodynamic coefficients.
Calculating these added mass, damping, and excitation coefficients with the traditional boundary element method presents a computational bottleneck, limiting the application of advanced design procedures like optimization.
The matched eigenfunction expansion method (MEEM), a long-known but rarely-used alternative, offers computational benefits due to its semi-analytical nature.
The authors use modern computing tools to implement an existing matched eigenfunction solution for the radiation of surface-piercing compound annular cylinders with continuous and radially-monotonic body profiles, releasing it in an open-source toolbox called OpenFLASH.
This paper systematically investigates numerical properties of the OpenFLASH MEEM implementation including accuracy, convergence, conditioning, and runtime.
Furthermore, it documents mathematical and computational subtleties not previously detailed, including alternate expressions for edge case geometries that otherwise yield indeterminate forms, and techniques that leverage convergence insights to improve model speed while preserving accuracy. 
Comparisons to the Capytaine boundary element method software show that OpenFLASH has XX\% accuracy, XX times faster runtime, XX better convergence, and XX times less memory use. 
Performance depends on geometry: larger diameters converge more slowly, and larger drafts require scaling to prevent numerical overflow.
Finally, the paper introduces a novel correction factor to extend the method to bodies with slanted (conical) surfaces, reducing the error for a frustum body from XX\% to XX\%. 
This correction factor, if combined with known extensions for moonpools and multi-valued vertical profiles, broadens the method's applicability to all concentric bodies of arbitrary profile, including concentric multi-body systems.
These contributions enable hydrodynamic analysis of a broad range of shapes with increased speed and confidence in the numerical accuracy, paving the way for future studies to apply optimization and yield improved designs.

\section{First-order heading}
\label{sec:headings}

The layout design for the {\em Journal of Fluid Mechanics} journal
has been implemented as a LaTeX\ style file.%
%\footnote{To know more information about LaTeX and its packages, try https://ctan.org/?lang=en}%
The FLM style file is based on the ARTICLE style as discussed in the LaTeX\ manual. Commands which
differ from the standard LaTeX\ interface, or which are provided in addition
to the standard interface, are explained in this guide. This guide is not a
substitute for the LaTeX\ manual itself.


\subsection{Introduction to LaTeX}

The LaTeX\ document preparation system is a special version of the
TeX\ typesetting program. LaTeX\ adds to TeX\ a collection of
commands which simplify typesetting by allowing the author to
concentrate on the logical structure of the document rather than
its visual layout.

LaTeX\ provides a consistent and comprehensive document preparation
interface. There are simple-to-use commands for generating a table of
contents, lists of figures and/or tables, and indexes. LaTeX\ can
automatically number list entries, equations, figures, tables, and
footnotes, as well as parts, chapters, sections and subsections.
Using this numbering system, bibliographic citations, page references
and cross references to any other numbered entity ({\it e.g.\ } chapter,
section, equation, figure, list entry) are quite straightforward.

\subsection{The FLM document class}

The use of document class allows a simple change of style (or style option)
to transform the appearance of your document. The CUP FLM class file preserves
the standard LaTeX\ interface such that any document which can be produced
using the standard LaTeX\ ARTICLE style can also be produced with the
FLM style. However, the fonts (sizes) and measure of text is slightly different
from that for ARTICLE, therefore line breaks will change and it is possible
that equations may need re-setting.



\section{Figures and Tables}\label{sec:Figures_Tables}

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics{figs/Fig1}}% Images in 100% size
  \caption{Trapped-mode wavenumbers, $kd$, plotted against $a/d$ for
    three ellipses: %\protect\\

\label{fig:ka}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Figures}
 Each figure should be accompanied by a single caption, to appear beneath, and must be cited in the text. Figures should appear in the order in which they are first mentioned in the text. For example see figures \ref{fig:ka} and \ref{fig:kd}.


\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics{figs/Fig2}}
  %\captionsetup{singlelinecheck=off,justification=center}
  \captionsetup{style=capcenter}
  \caption{The features of the four possible modes corresponding to
  (\textit{a}) periodic %\protect\\
  and (\textit{b})~half-periodic solutions.}
\label{fig:kd}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}
Tables, however small, must be numbered sequentially in the order in which they are mentioned in the text. Words \textit {table~1, table~2} should be lower case throughout. See table~\ref{tab:kd} for an example.


\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
\def~{\hphantom{0}}

\end{table}

\section{Notation and style}\label{notstyle}
 Generally any queries concerning notation and journal style can be answered by viewing recent pages in the Journal. However, the following guide provides the key points to note. It is expected that Journal style and mathematical notation will be followed, and authors should take care to define all variables or entities upon first use. Also note that footnotes are not normally accepted.  Abbreviations must be defined at first use, glossaries or lists/tables of abbreviations are not permitted.

\subsection{Mathematical notation}
\subsubsection{Setting variables, functions, vectors, matrices etc}
\begin{itemize} \label{sec:MathNot}
\item {\bf Italic font} should be used for denoting variables, with multiple-letter symbols avoided except in the case of dimensionless numbers such as $\Rey$, $\Pran$ and $\Pen$ (Reynolds, Prandtl, and P\'eclet numbers respectively, which are defined as \verb}\Rey}, \verb}\Pran} and \verb}\Pen} in the template).
\item {\bf Upright Roman font} (or upright Greek where appropriate) should be used for:
\begin{enumerate}%[1.]
\item (vI) label, e.g.  T. t (transpose)
\item Fixed operators: sin, log, d, $\Delta$, exp etc.
\item Constants: i ($\sqrt{-1}$), $\upi$ (defined as \verb}\upi}),e  etc.
\item Special Functions: $\Ai$, $\Bi$ (Airy functions, defined as \verb}\Ai} and \verb}\Bi}), $\Real$ (real part, defined as \verb}\Real}), $\Imag$ (imaginary part, defined as \verb}\Imag}), etc.
\item Physical units: cm, s, etc.
\item Abbreviations: c.c. (complex conjugate), h.o.t. (higher-order terms), DNS, etc.
\end{enumerate}
\item {\bf Bold italic font} (or bold sloping Greek) should be used for vectors (with the centred dot for a scalar product also in bold): $\boldsymbol{i \cdot j}$
\item {\bf Bold sloping sans serif font}, defined by the \verb}\mathsfbi} macro, should be used for tensors and matrices: $\mathsfbi{D}$
\item {\bf Calligraphic font} (for example $\mathcal{G}$, $\mathcal{R}$) can be used as an alternative to italic when the same letter denotes a different quantity use \verb}\mathcal} in \LaTeX)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Other symbols}

Large numbers  that are not scientific powers should not include commas, but should use a non-breaking space, and use the form 1600 or 16 000 or 160 000.
Use \textit{O} to denote `of the order of', not the \LaTeX\ $\mathcal{O}$.

The product symbol ($\times$) should only be used to denote multiplication where an equation is broken over more than one line, to denote a cross product, or between numbers . The $\boldsymbol {\cdot}$ symbol should not be used, except to denote a scalar product of vectors specifically.

\subsubsection{Example Equations}

This section contains sample equations in the JFM style. Please refer to the {\LaTeX} source file for examples of how to display such equations in your manuscript.

\begin{equation}
  (\nabla^2+k^2)G_s=(\nabla^2+k^2)G_a=0
  \label{Helm}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \bnabla\bcdot\boldsymbol{v} = 0,\quad \nabla^{2}P=
    \bnabla\bcdot(\boldsymbol{v}\times \boldsymbol{w}).
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  G_s,G_a\sim 1 / (2\upi)\ln r
  \quad \mbox{as\ }\quad r\equiv|P-Q|\rightarrow 0,
  \label{singular}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\left. \begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle\frac{\p G_s}{\p y}=0
  \quad \mbox{on\ }\quad y=0,\\[8pt]
\displaystyle  G_a=0
  \quad \mbox{on\ }\quad y=0,
 \end{array}\right\}
  \label{symbc}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  -\frac{1}{2\upi} \int_0^{\infty} \gamma^{-1}[\mathrm exp(-k\gamma|y-\eta|)
   + \mathrm exp(-k\gamma(2d-y-\eta))] \cos k(x-\xi)t\:\mathrm{d} t,
   \qquad 0<y,\quad \eta<d,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \gamma(t) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      -\mathrm{i}(1-t^2)^{1/2}, & t\le 1 \\[2pt]
      (t^2-1)^{1/2},         & t>1.
    \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
\[
  -\frac{1}{2\upi}
   \pvi B(t)\frac{\cosh k\gamma(d-y)}{\gamma\sinh k\gamma d}
   \cos k(x-\xi)t\:\mathrm{d} t
\]
\begin{equation}
  G = -\frac{1}{4}\mathrm{i} (H_0(kr)+H_0(kr_1))
    - \frac{1}{\upi} \pvi\frac{\mathrm{e}^{-\kgd}}%
    {\gamma\sinh\kgd} \cosh k\gamma(d-y) \cosh k\gamma(d-\eta)
\end{equation}

Note that when equations are included in definitions, it may be suitable to render them~in~line, rather than in the equation environment: $\boldsymbol{n}_q=(-y^{\prime}(\theta),
x^{\prime}(\theta))/w(\theta)$.
Now $G_a=\squart Y_0(kr)+\Gat$ where
$r=\{[x(\theta)-x(\psi)]^2 + [y(\theta)-y(\psi)]^2\}^{1/2}$ and $\Gat$ is
regular as $kr\ttz$. However, any fractions displayed like this, other than $\thalf$ or $\squart$, must be written on the line, and not stacked (ie 1/3).
\begin{eqnarray}
  \ndq\left(\frac{1}{4} Y_0(kr)\right) & \sim &
    \frac{1}{4\upi w^3(\theta)}
    [x^{\prime\prime}(\theta)y^{\prime}(\theta)-
    y^{\prime\prime}(\theta)x^{\prime}(\theta)] \nonumber\\
  & = & \frac{1}{4\upi w^3(\theta)}
    [\rho^{\prime}(\theta)\rho^{\prime\prime}(\theta)
    - \rho^2(\theta)-2\rho^{\prime 2}(\theta)]
    \quad \mbox{as\ }\quad kr\ttz . \label{inteqpt}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{2}\phi_i = \frac{\upi}{M} \sumjm\phi_j K_{ij}^a w_j,

\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  K_{ij}^a = \left\{

\begin{corollary}
Any non-zero trial function $f$ which satisfies the boundary condition
$f(0)=f(1)=0$ always satisfies

\section{Additional facilities}

In addition to all the standard LaTeX\ design elements, the FLM style
includes the following feature:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Extended commands for specifying a short version
        of the title and author(s) for the running
        headlines.
\end{itemize}
Once you have used this additional facility in your document,
do not process it with a standard LaTeX\ style file.

\subsection{Titles authors' names and affiliation}

In the FLM style, the title of the article and the author's name (or authors'
names) are used both at the beginning of the article for the main title and
throughout the article as running headlines at the top of every page.
The Journal title is used on odd-numbered pages (rectos) and the author's name appears
on even-numbered pages (versos).
Although the main heading can run to several lines of text, the running head
line must be a single line.

Moreover, the main heading can also incorporate new line commands
({\it e.g.\ } \verb"\\") but these are not acceptable in a running headline.
To enable you to specify an alternative short title and author's name, the
standard \verb"\righttitle" and \verb"\lefttitle" commands have been used to print the running headline.
\verb"\corresau{}" command should be used to provide the corresponding author details as shown below.
%
\begin{verbatim}

\righttitle{Journal of Fluid Mechanics}

\corresau{Alan N. Jones, \email{Jones@univ.edu}}
\end{verbatim}
%

\subsection{Abstract}

The FLM style provides for an abstract which is produced by the following
commands
%
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{abstract}  ...  \end{abstract}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Keywords}

The FLM style provides for an keywords which is produced by the following
commands
%
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{keywords}  ...  \begin{keywords}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Lists}

The FLM style provides the three standard list environments.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bulleted lists, created using the \verb"itemize" environment.
  \item Numbered lists, created using the \verb"enumerate" environment.
  \item Labelled lists, created using the \verb"description" environment.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Footnotes}

The FLM journal style uses superior numbers for footnote
references.\footnote{This shows how a footnote is typeset.}

\section{Some guidelines for using standard facilities}

The following notes may help you achieve the best effects with the FLM style
file.

\subsection{Sections}

LaTeX\ provides five levels of section headings and they are all
defined in the FLM style file:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb"\section".
  \item \verb"\subsection".
  \item \verb"\subsubsection".
  \item \verb"\paragraph".
  \item \verb"\subparagraph".
\end{itemize}
Section numbers are given for sections, subsection and subsubsection headings.

\subsection{Running headlines}

As described above, the title of the journal and the author's name (or authors'
names) are used as running headlines at the top of every page.
The title is used on odd-numbered pages (rectos) and the author's name appears
on even-numbered pages (versos).

The \verb"\pagestyle" and \verb"\thispagestyle" commands should {\em not\/} be
used.
Similarly, the commands \verb"\markright" and \verb"\markboth" should not be
necessary.

\subsection{Illustrations (or figures)}

The FLM style will cope with most positioning of your illustrations
and you should not normally use the optional positional qualifiers on
the \verb"figure" environment which would override these decisions.
Figure captions should be below the figure itself, therefore the \verb"\caption"
command should appear after the figure or space left for an illustration.

Figure~\ref{sample-figure} shows an example on working with LaTeX code to load art files. \verb"\includegraphics" commnad is to load art files \verb"scale" option used in \verb"\includegraphics" is to reduce the art. EPS format will be compiled using LaTeX. Also, PNG, PDF and JPG format art files are loaded in the same command but the TeX file should be compiled using PDFLaTeX:
%
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[scale=.4]{sample.eps}
    \caption{An example figure with space for artwork.}
    \label{sample-figure}
  \end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
%
\begin{figure}%[t]
  \centerline{\fbox{\vbox to 8pc{\hbox to 10pc{}}}}
  %\includegraphics[scale=.4]{sample.eps}
  \caption{An example figure with space for artwork.}
  \label{sample-figure}
\end{figure}
%
The vertical depth should correspond roughly to the artwork you will submit;
it will be adjusted to fit the final artwork exactly.

\subsection{Creating new theorem-like environments}

You can create your own environments in LaTeX, and although you may already
be familiar with \verb"\newtheorem", you will not have seen the other two
commands explained below.

\verb"\newtheorem" is a standard command used for creating new
        theorem-like environments, such as theorems, corollaries, lemmas,
        conjectures and propositions, with the body of the text
        (automatically) in italic.

\section{Mathematics}

The FLM class file will centre displayed mathematics, and will insert the
correct space above and below if standard LaTeX\ commands are used; for
example use \verb"\[ ... \]" and \emph{not} \verb"$$ ... $$". Do not leave
blank lines above and below displayed equations unless a new paragraph is
really intended.

\verb"amsmath.sty" is common package to handle various type math equations was used in template. The amsmath descriptions are available in the document can be find in the web link \verb"https://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath?lang=en"

\subsection{Numbering of equations}

The \verb"subequations" and \verb"subeqnarray" environments have been
incorporated into the FLM class file (see Section~\ref{sub:amstex} regarding
the \verb"subequations" environment). Using these two environments,
you can number your equations (\ref{a1}), (\ref{a2}) etc. automatically.
For example, you can typeset
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{equation}
    a_1 \equiv (2\Omega M^2/x)^{\textstyle\frac{1}{4}}
      y^{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\label{a1}
  \end{equation}
  and
  \begin{equation}
    a_2 \equiv (x/2\Omega)^{TeXtstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_y/M.\label{a2}
  \end{equation}
  \end{subequations}
by using the \verb"subequations" environment as follows:
%
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{equation}
    a_1 \equiv (2\Omega M^2/x)^{\textstyle\frac{1}{4}}
      y^{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\label{a1}
  \end{equation}
  and
  \begin{equation}
    a_2 \equiv (x/2\Omega)^{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_y/M.\label{a2}
  \end{equation}
  \end{subequations}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{The \texttt{subequations} environment and the
  \texttt{AMSTEX} package} \label{sub:amstex}

The \verb"amstex" (and the \verb"amsmath") packages also define a
\verb"subequations" environment.  The environment in \verb"JFM-FLM_Au.cls" is used
by default, as the environments in the AMS packages don't produce the correct
style of output.

Note that the \verb"subequations" environment from the \verb"amstex" package
takes an argument -- you should use an `a' to give \verb"\alph" style
subequations. e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{subequations}{a}  ...  \end{subequations}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Bibliography}

As with standard LaTeX, there are two ways of producing a bibliography; either by compiling a list of references by hand (using a \verb"thebibliography" environment), or by using BibTeX with a suitable bibliographic database with the bibliography style provided with this FLMguide.tex like \verb"\bibliographystyle{jfm}". The "jfm.bst" will produce the bibliography which is similar to FLM style but not exactly. If any modification has to be made with "jfm.bst" can be adjusted during manuscript preparation but the updated bst file should be given with source files. However, contributors are encouraged to format their list of references style outlined in section~\ref{fullref} below.

\subsubsection{References in the text}

References in the text are given by author and date.
Whichever method is used to produce the bibliography, the references in
the text are done in the same way. Each bibliographical entry has a key,
which is assigned by the author and used to refer to that entry in the
text. There is one form of citation -- \verb"\cite{key}" -- to produce the
author and date. Thus, \cite{Arntzenius2012} is produced~by
\begin{verbatim}
  \cite{Arntzenius2012}.
\end{verbatim}

In FLM, for references \verb"natbib.sty" is used. \verb"natbib.sty" is common
package to handle various reference and its cross citations. There different
type of cross citation such as \verb"\citep",  \verb"\citet" , \verb"\citeyear"
etc. of the natbib descriptions are available in the document can be find in the web
link \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib?lang=en}

\paragraph{Examples:}

Sample of basic cross citations examples from natbib \citep{Arntzenius2012} and \citet{Arntzenius2012}. Similarly other command can be utilized from referring the description from \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib?lang=en}

If citations have to sort then use the class option "citesort".

\subsubsection{List of references}\label{fullref}

Each entry takes the form
%

%
where \verb"Author(s)"\ should be the author names as they are cited in
the text, \verb"Date" is the date to be cited in the text, and \verb"tag"
is the tag that is to be used as an argument for the \verb"\cite{}" command.
\verb"Bibliography entry" should be the
material that is to appear in the bibliography, suitably formatted.  This
rather unwieldy scheme makes up for the lack of an author-date system in
LaTeX.

\section{Notes for Editors}

This appendix contains additional information which may be useful to
those who are involved with the final production stages of an article.
Authors, who are generally not typesetting the final pages in the
journal's typeface (Monotype Times), do not need this information.
