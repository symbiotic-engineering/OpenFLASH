	abstract = {Numerical results for the added mass of a heaving two-dimensional body in finite-depth water show that the zero-frequency limit is different for the cases of a surface-piercing body and a bottom-mounted body of the same wetted shape. At first sight, this may appear surprising as the limiting boundary-value problems for the potentials involved are identical. However the solutions are indeterminate to within an additive constant and it is the value of this constant that accounts for the difference. In the present work, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to show that the added mass limits for the two cases differ by an amount that depends very simply on the geometry of the bodies.},

	abstract = {The second-order diffraction problem by a piston-like arrangement that consists of two concentric surface piercing cylinders is considered. The developed matched axisymmetric eigenfunction expansion solution methodology in cylindrical co-ordinates is based on the semi-analytical formulation of the velocity potentials in the various fluid regions which are defined by the geometry of the two-body arrangement. The main difficulty associated with the specific configuration originates from the fact that the geometry defines two fluid regions that extend up to the free surface in which the inhomogeneous second-order free surface boundary condition has to be fulfilled. To this end the associated velocity potentials in these regions are decomposed into a number of components defining the so-called ‘free’ and ‘locked’ waves. The latter are calculated by solving the resulting Sturm–Liouville problems. The seek second-order velocity potential in the whole fluid domain is then derived by enforcing matching conditions for the radial velocities and the fluid pressures at the cylindrical boundaries of adjacent fluid domains. Numerical results concerning the second-order hydrodynamic loading and the wave run-up on the cylinders are given, whereas special attention is given at incident wave frequency regions where the first-order exciting wave forces attain maximum values due to the resonant fluid motions in the moonpool.},

A semi-analytical approach is proposed for the computation of the hydrodynamic coefficients and the excitation forces. The boundary value problem is solved by using variable separation and matched eigenfunction expansion methods. Analytical expressions for the velocity potential are then obtained for each subdomain. The hydrodynamic coefficients and the excitation force can then be computed by using these expressions.

	abstract = {We propose a novel Triple Coaxial-cylinder Wave-Energy Converter (TCWEC) system, as an evolution of the commonly deployed dual-coaxial cylinder WEC (DCWEC). TCWEC consists of one inner cylinder and two concentric outer cylinders, characterized by two coupled resonant frequencies, improving wave power absorption. A semi-analytical model, based on potential flow theory and matched eigenfunction expansions, is developed to analyze the 3-Degrees of Freedom (DOF) system. The viscous drag coefficients are determined by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and employed as equivalent linear damping. Analysis of impact of the viscous flow-separation factor fvis on the capture width indicates that the higher energy-absorption capability of TCWEC is not merely attributed to a smaller fvis value, but rather a planned split of the outer cylinder in DCWEC design into two cylinders in TCWEC, so as to produce an effectively broader resonance property. Under identical sea conditions, it is found that, compared to DCWEC, the optimal capture width of TCWEC is increased by as much as 77\% in regular waves. In irregular waves, the optimal capture width is increased up to 40\% across the entire frequency range. These findings suggest that the energy absorption efficiency of TCWEC is promising and its potential for real-world applications.},

Several relationships are then derived between the hydrodynamic parameters of the system. Comparison is made between the behaviour of the converter in the open ocean and in a channel. The degree of accuracy of wave tank experiments aiming at reproducing the performance of the device in the open ocean is quantified. A parametric analysis of the system is then undertaken. In particular, it is shown that increasing the flap width has the beneficial effect of broadening the bandwidth of the capture factor curve.

The technique of control surfaces is used to overcome the difficulty associated with the singularity of the fluid velocity at the corner, and a novel solution to the double-frequency wave radiation force on a surging/heaving truncated cylinder is developed. The proposed solution achieves an obvious advantage in that the calculation of the singular terms owing to the singularity of the fluid velocity at a sharp corner is avoided. After examining the convergence and validity of the proposed model, numerical studies are conducted. Numerical results reveal that the force component associated with the body-surface forcing term predominates among the various force components of the total double-frequency wave radiation force.

Similar to the case of axially symmetric absorbers, the maximum power extracted is shown to be directly proportional to the incident wave characteristics: energy flux, angle of incidence and wavelength. Accordingly, the capture width ratio is directly proportional to the wavelength, thus giving a design estimate of the maximum efficiency of the system. We then compare the array and the single gate in terms of energy production. For regular waves, we show that excitation of the out-of-phase natural modes of the array increases the power output, while in the case of random seas we show that the array and the single gate achieve the same efficiency.},

	abstract = {The absorber is known to be vertical axisymmetric for a single-point wave energy converter (WEC). The shape of the wetted surface usually has a great influence on the absorber’s hydrodynamic characteristics which are closely linked with the wave power conversion ability. For complex wetted surface, the hydrodynamic coefficients have been predicted traditionally by hydrodynamic software based on the BEM. However, for a systematic study of various parameters and geometries, they are too multifarious to generate so many models and data grids. This paper examines a semi-analytical method of decomposing the complex axisymmetric boundary into several ring-shaped and stepped surfaces based on the boundary discretization method (BDM) which overcomes the previous difficulties. In such case, by using the linear wave theory based on eigenfunction expansion matching method, the expressions of velocity potential in each domain, the added mass, radiation damping and wave excitation forces of the oscillating absorbers are obtained. The good astringency of the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave forces are obtained for various geometries when the discrete number reaches a certain value. The captured wave power for a same given draught and displacement for various geometries are calculated and compared. Numerical results show that the geometrical shape has great effect on the wave conversion performance of the absorber. For absorbers with the same outer radius and draught or displacement, the cylindrical type shows fantastic wave energy conversion ability at some given frequencies, while in the random sea wave, the parabolic and conical ones have better stabilization and applicability in wave power conversion.},

We propose a scientifically rigorous framework to find realistic optimal geometries of wave energy converters (WECs). For specificity, we assume WECs to be axisymmetric point absorbers in a monochromatic unidirectional incident wave, all within the context of linearised potential theory. We consider separately the problem of a WEC moving and extracting wave energy in heave only and then the more general case of motion and extraction in combined heave, surge and pitch. We describe the axisymmetric geometries using polynomial basis functions, allowing for discontinuities in slope. Our framework involves ensuring maximum power, specifying practical motion constraints and then minimising surface area (as a proxy for cost). The framework is robust and well-posed, and the optimisation produces feasible WEC geometries. Using the proposed framework, we develop a systematic computational and theoretical approach, and we obtain results and insights for the optimal WEC geometries. The optimisation process is sped up significantly by a new theoretical result to obtain roots of the heave resonance equation. For both the heave-only, and the heave-surge-pitch combined problems, we find that geometries which protrude outward below the waterline are generally optimal. These optimal geometries have up to 73 \% less surface area and 90 \% less volume than the optimal cylinders which extract the same power.},

An incident plane wave is expanded in Bessel functions and for each mode the problem is formulated in terms of the radial displacement on the cylindrical interface below the cylinder. The solution is obtainable either from an infinite set of simultaneous equations or from an integral equation. It is shown that the phase of the solution is independent of depth and resonances are found at wave-numbers close to those of free oscillations in a cylinder extending to the bottom. If the resonances of the cylinder are made sharper (by increasing the depth of immersion) the peak response of the harbour increases, but the response to a continuous spectrum remains approximately constant. Numerical results are obtained by minimizing the least squares error of a finite number N of simultaneous equations. Convergence is slow, but the error is roughly proportional to 1/N and this is exploited. The solution obtained from a variational formulation using the incoming wave as a trial function is found to give a very good approximation for small wave-numbers, but is increasingly inaccurate for large wave-numbers. Away from resonance the amplitude of the harbour oscillation is less than 10\% of the amplitude of the incoming wave provided the depth of the cylinder is greater than about ¼ wavelength, and it is argued that in practice at the resonant wave-number oscillations excited through the bottom of the harbour will leak out through the entrance before they can reach large amplitudes. In an appendix the excitation of harbour oscillations through the harbour entrance is discussed, and some results of Miles \& Munk (1961) on an alleged harbour paradox are re-interpreted.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive set of theoretical added masses and wave damping data for a floating circular cylinder in finite-depth water is presented. The hydrodynamic problem is solved by matching eigen functions of the interior and exterior problems. The resulting infinite system is solved directly and found to have excellent truncation characteristics. Added mass and damping are given for heave, sway, and roll motion, as well as coupling coefficients for sway and roll. It is shown that the heave added mass is logarithmic singular and the damping approaches a constant in the low-frequency limit. Transition of the behaviour in finite-depth water to deep water is also discussed.},
