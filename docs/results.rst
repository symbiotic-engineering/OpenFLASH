The `results` module defines the :py:class:`Results` class, which is responsible
for efficiently storing, accessing, and exporting the complex output data from OpenFLASH. It leverages the `xarray` library to manage multi-dimensional
datasets, providing a structure similar to Capytaine's conventions for hydrodynamic data.
