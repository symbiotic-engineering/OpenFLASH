Introduction
============

This documentation provides an overview of the **Matched Eigenfunctions Project (MEEM)**, a framework for solving boundary value problems using eigenfunction expansion methods. Designed for researchers and engineers, MEEM is ideal for fields requiring precise numerical solutions to complex physical problems.

Project Overview
----------------

The MEEM framework is composed of several key components:

- **Geometry**: Defines the spatial properties and configurations of the domains, creating domain objects with specific attributes.
- **Domain**: Represents individual physical regions, including their unique properties and boundary conditions.
- **MEEMProblem**: Manages multiple domains, ensuring proper matching of boundary conditions between adjacent domains.
- **MEEMEngine**: Executes core numerical computations, constructs necessary matrices, and provides visualization tools for analysis.

Workflow
--------

To use MEEM effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Define Geometry**: Use the Geometry class to specify the layout and properties of your physical domain.
2. **Set Up Domains**: Create Domain objects for each region, detailing the physical characteristics and boundary conditions.
3. **Initialize MEEMProblem**: Create an instance of MEEMProblem to manage the problem setup and perform boundary condition matching.
4. **Run Computations**: Use MEEMEngine to execute numerical computations, assemble matrices, and visualize the results.

Refer to each class section for specific examples, parameter options, and code snippets.

Getting Started
---------------

To begin using MEEM:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all required libraries are installed. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
2. **Import Modules**: In your Python environment, import necessary modules based on your specific problem.
3. **Review Examples**: Check each class documentation section for code examples and application cases.
