Introduction
============

This documentation provides an overview of the matched eigenfunctions project, which aims to solve boundary value problems through eigenfunction expansion methods. The project is designed for researchers and engineers working in fields requiring precise numerical solutions to complex physical problems.

Overview
--------

The project consists of several key components:

- **Geometry**: Defines the spatial characteristics and creates domain objects.
- **Domain**: Represents individual physical domains, including their properties and boundary conditions.
- **MEEM_problem**: Manages multiple domains and coordinates the matching of boundary conditions.
- **MEEM_engine**: Executes the main numerical methods for solving the equations, assembling matrices, and visualizing results.

Usage
-----

Follow these steps to utilize this project:

1. Instantiate the Geometry Class: Begin by defining the geometric properties of your physical domain.
2. Define Your Domains: Create objects using the Domain class that represent the physical characteristics and boundary conditions of your domains.
3. Create MEEM_problem Instances: Manage the overall problem setup and ensure that boundary conditions are matched across different domains.
4. Perform Numerical Computations: Leverage the MEEM_engine to execute the numerical methods and visualize the results of your analysis.

For detailed usage examples and code snippets, please refer to the specific class documentation sections.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with the matched eigenfunctions project:
