Introduction
============

This documentation provides an overview of the matched eigenfunctions project, which aims to solve boundary value problems through eigenfunction expansion methods. The project is designed for researchers and engineers working in fields requiring precise numerical solutions to complex physical problems.

Overview
--------

The project consists of several key components:

- **Geometry**: Defines the spatial characteristics and creates domain objects.
- **Domain**: Represents individual physical domains, including their properties and boundary conditions.
- **MEEM_problem**: Manages multiple domains and coordinates the matching of boundary conditions.
- **MEEM_engine**: Executes the main numerical methods for solving the equations, assembling matrices, and visualizing results.

Usage
-----

To use this project, you will need to instantiate the `Geometry` class, define your domains using the `Domain` class, and then create `MEEM_problem` instances to manage the problem setup. The `MEEM_engine` is used to perform the numerical computations and visualization.

For detailed usage and examples, refer to the specific class documentation.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with the matched eigenfunctions project:

1. Install the required dependencies (if any).
2. Import the necessary modules in your Python environment.
3. Follow the examples provided in the respective class documentation to implement your specific problem.
