Constants
==========

This module defines several physical and mathematical constants used throughout the project.

Constants
----------

- **g**: Acceleration due to gravity (m/s²) — \(9.81\)
- **pi**: The mathematical constant π — \( \pi \)
- **h**: A project-specific constant 
- **a1**: A project-specific constant 
- **a2**: A project-specific constant 
- **d1**: A project-specific constant 
- **d2**: A project-specific constant 
- **m0**: A project-specific constant 
- **n**: A project-specific constant 
- **z**: A project-specific constant
- **omega**: A project-specific constant 

Usage Example
-------------

You can import and use these constants in your calculations as follows:

```python  
from constants import g, pi  
```

Ensure to use the correct import path  

Example of using the gravitational constant  
mass = 5.0  
(Example mass in kg)

force = mass * g  

print("Force:", force)  

(Output the force)
