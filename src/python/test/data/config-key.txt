Parenthetical values are matching points (real, imag), with rtol = 0.03, real atol = 0.01, imag atol = 0.0001.
Other values are what was inputted into capytaine for the corresponding configurations, and what the hydro coefficient outputs were.
Note: Capytaine convention does not multiply hydro coefficients by a factor of h^3.
Capytaine may be unable to model multi-body systems (e.g. one shell heaving, one not)
